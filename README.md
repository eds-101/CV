## Edeman George

A technology professional who has a wide breadth of experience, starting my career as a management consultant and recently working as a freelancer.

I have been keen to pursue a career in software development for a number of years as I've enjoyed my more active and creative pursuits. I was fortunate to join Makers Academy's software development bootcamp to learn and develop a variety of skills such as test-driven development, communication and teamwork. I look forward to transitioning to a role at a company where I can share and debate innovative ideas and make signicant contributions.

## Skills

### Communication & Attention to detail
* I led on a ticketing and gate receipts study, requiring 20 football clubs to submit ~300 data points to challenging timelines. A number of submissions had questionable or incomplete input. I organised hour long video calls with these teams and colour highlighted and sent back teams' discrepancies in advance of the call. This allowed dedicated time to work and gave attendees time to double check and confirm their data ahead of the call. During the sessions I was able to walk through all key data points in detail, learning about the context of the input or misunderstandings. As a result, we had more understanding and confidence on the data and also improved our templates by updating areas of uncertainty.
* During Makers Academy I worked in a Scrum Master role on a project to make a Facebook clone using Ruby on Rails for the first time, as part of a sociable team who had notable uncertainty about potential solutions. I identified Planning Poker as a method to help the team discuss how we could complete each of user stories. In order to help this work I had to consider the wider journey. I took charge of using a Trello board to break down the user stories, and before introducing the Planning Poker I explained why it would be beneficial and then organised a practice game using complexity of making a roast dinner. These actions were effective in helping the team to understand each other's ideas and contributed to increased development speed, as everyone had contributed, at a high level, to potential solutions.

### Teamwork
* As a Project Manager I was responsible for recording project status against the plan and also had daily update calls with the General Manager (GM). Early on in the project I was introduced to a work stream lead who also kept a project man and mentioned she was often delayed when trying to speak with the GM. I was helpful here in organising regular sessions to share our project updates, and note her outstanding queries to raise in my sessions with the GM. This improved project efficiency as we stopped overlapping on our requests to colleagues and additionally we built a good working relationship based on helping each other save time.
* During Makers Academy there was conflict over the chosen idea and technologies to implement for the final project, which was starting to impact development time. I helped by organising a session to write out everyone's ideas and proposed features and organised a vote to narrow the focus. For the ideas that didn't get chose I helped to offer suggestions of how some features could translate to our project. Furthermore I allowed other team member's preference to work on the areas that they had shown interest in initially. These actions helped to build inclusive working practices and add focus and direction to our work.

### Adaptability
* As a Project Manager, I started mid project and initially had daily catch ups with the General Manager (GM) to learn more and clarify my project understanding. On day 3 and 4 the GM unexpectedly had to cancel our catch ups and became unreachable. I remained output and end-goal focussed whilst adjusting to account for the change. I shared end of day email summary updates to ensure the GM was still updated. I kept a log of questions to ask and also asked for support from other project colleagues, so I could still build on my project knowledge. When meeting important stakeholders with minimal context, I also briefly explained the context at the start of the conversation and set expectations, so that the stakeholders were able to speak in more depth about areas I was unfamiliar with. These actions allowed me to continue to settle into the project at pace and start delivering value with project plans and stakeholder meetings.
* During my final project at Makers I worked in a team which decided to focus on learning how the MERN stack worked, as opposed to delivering lots of features which was my preference. I adjusted by spending more time trying to explain and demo my key contributions to the group, such as implementing a feature for posting a message. I also joined in on numerous pairing sessions to help troubleshoot issues, which helped project progress but also actively work in more areas of the project. Finally, to satisfy myself, I pledged to spend some time after the project to try and implement some of my own ideas. This meant that I stayed aligned with the team's preferences and that we had good working practices, since we focussed on our shared objectives.
* At Makers I worked in a team which produced an MVP version of our mobile app Grappitude in just three days, despite using the MERN stack for the first time. This involved learning a lot of new concepts, assessing and sharing resources plus feeding back and negotiating with the team to ensure that we were aligned and making progress.
* I also worked in a project where only one other team member was present after a week. We adjusted our expectations and reduced the scope, conscious that we would not meet our original targets but still remaining upbeat. Rather than deliver full working features, we gained further experience using CSS and styling, which supported future projects.
